**😄 DetectingSmile**

A Python-based real-time smile detection system using computer vision and deep learning. This project identifies smiles
from live webcam feeds or images, enabling interactive applications like emotion-aware interfaces and gesture-based
controls.

**🚀 Project Overview**

DetectingSmile captures facial features from video or images and predicts whether the person is smiling. It leverages
computer vision techniques for face detection and a trained model for smile classification, allowing real-time inference
with high accuracy.

**🛠 Features**

Real-time smile detection using webcam

Facial detection with OpenCV or pretrained CNN models

Preprocessing and normalization of face images

Modular pipeline for training and inference

Visualization of detection results in live feed

**📦 Requirements**

Python 3.x

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (depending on model)

NumPy

**🤝 Contributing**

Contributions are welcome to improve detection accuracy, support multiple emotions, or extend the system to video
datasets.
